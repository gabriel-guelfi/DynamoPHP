In this release 1.4.11 it was added several CLI built-in commands. It also has many improvements and fixes in data handling and access.
Requests were also improved, with new features and fixes, besides some other minor fixes.

---

**New Features:**

- Added on composer. (Yes, it's finally here! xD)

- A built-in scafolding command "generate" was added in this version. Now the user is able to generate Services, Web Services and Commands using the CLI.

- DAO now has a "clearPersistence()" method to manually clear the data persistence.

- Added some Utils methods to work with string conversion (valid JSON check and convert data to UTF-8)

- Dao::bindParams() method now accepts a second parameter for a placeholder name: the user define the placeholder in the second param of bindParams(), then 
place it in the query wherever he wants the parameters to be bound

- Added the option of use "IN/NOT IN" operators with bindParams() method and in DAO filter methods.  

- Expanded System::errorLog() method to include further, more detailed information.

---

**Fixes:**

- Fixed bug in Dao::fetch() method, in which $debug argument wasn't working properly.

- On requests with verb DELETE, the system was messing cookies and other request related data with 
input data (body + route params).

- Exceptions thrown within CLI commands wasn't handling code parameter properly.

- XSRF token wasn't available outside endpoint function context, so if the user tried to use 
$this->xsrfToken() in a Web Service method, it would not work. Now the scope of $ths->xsrfToken() method
is the whole Web Service not just the endpoint function context.

- In some cases, when filtering queries, numeric strings were being converted to number values in the database.
Now it is fixed and a numeric string is preserved as it is after enters the database.

- If a Web Service file exists, but the classname of the Web Service were different from the name of the file,
the system was throwing an exception captured in system_log, but the response were returning status 200, with no content.

- Multiple inserts were not working when some of the values were NULL.

- NULL values were not being handled properly in database filtering operations, which was causing the program to crash due to a 
malformed query.

- Fixed a vulnerability found in input sanitizing, which was making the system open to SQL injection attacks.
