In this release 1.4.10 it was added several CLI built-in commands. It also has many improvements in Data Access.

---

**New Features:**

- Now the user can forcefully commit a specific database operation, even with the transactional db setting turned on, 
without affecting the rest of the application.

- Database operations charset setting.

- Improved error logging with more useful data.

- Added a CLI, very simple to use, which on the user can create his own commands, in the same way he can create endpoints.

- Removed some services dependencies from WebServices.

- Added a cool feature on database reading: now the system persists the data in the RAM, so if you execute the exact same query multiple times, 
it will only run the SQL once.

- All response's codes are now being checked, if the user try to respond with a status out of the range 100-599, the system throws an exception. 

- Added a built-in command "server:start", which initiates a local development server at "http://localhost:8000"

- Added a built-in command "setup", which automatically creates a "config.ini" file from the example and generates random hashes for your application's 
PUBLIC_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY settings. 

- Application's timezone is now easily set in config.ini file and this settings also affects the database operations.

---

**Fixes:**

- Some specific errors and exceptions, depending on the type or level of the error or exception, was not being sent to the client, the system was 
responding 200 with no content and no log was being generated. These issues were fixed.

- Service::getService() method now validates the service's path which is being passed along. If an invalid path is passed, throws an exception.

- Now the Dao::getTable() method check if your DB_CONNECT setting is turned on. Throws an exception otherwise.

- Changed the name of the class "RestService" to "WebService", which represents better the concept of this class. (Don't worry, I kept a backward compatibility)

- Fixed the name of the method Dao::lesserThan() to Dao::lessThan(). (English isn't my mother language, sorry! xD)

Well, I think it's now much more stable, versatile and with some really nice new features. 

Hope y'all enjoy!
