=====

This release 1.1.4 has some improvements with database operations, included a feature to perform CURLs easier and have some fixes. 
See the list below for further details

=====

New Features: 

- Standard .gitignore file, so logs, cache and tests won't mess with the official application's repository anymore.

- Automatic transactional operations: now everything that happens inside a request/response cycle is wrapped 
by a transaction, so if something goes wrong along the way, Dynamo will roll back all database operations that 
were done until that time. This guarantees data consistence. You can also turn this off on config.ini file.

- Services now has a method named "requestURL()", which provides an easy way to perform CURL calls.

- The method find from DAO class, now accepts no parameters, creating a default SQL query that brings all fields 
from the working table. So, if you just want to get all fields from a table, you don't have to write the query 
anymore, just call: $this->getTable('TABLENAME')->find(). You can also apply filters to this query, using the filtering methods.

=====

Fixes:

- Removed those annoying references to Pesticide, which was a legacy debugger that came from the previous versions. 
Pesticide was already removed, but some references to it were still within the engine. It is all removed now.

- There was a bug where POST and PUT endpoints weren't receiving the parameters passed through the query string. Now it's solved.

- DAO operations wasn't working when called directly from Rest Services. The bug is fixed.

- Fixed the location of errors with user readable messages and added 2 more errors.

=====

So, this release was intended to create features that make the developer's life easier, also improved the consistence of 
the resulting applications and, of course, fixed some bugs. Hope you enjoy!
