Dynamo is a Micro-service architecture, RESTful friendly micro framework. It is made to be simple and lean, with a low learning curve. Its mission is to be a ready-to-work tool with simplified installation and interface. Knowledge required to understand and maintain an application written with this framework is basic PHP and OOP. No more installing and configuring thousands of softwares just to begin to code. 

A documentation is being built. You can refer to what is already in place in [here](http://docs.dynamophp.org)
